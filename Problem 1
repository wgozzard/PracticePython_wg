#Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

#Extras:
#Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and printing out that many copies of the previous message. (Hint: order of operations exists in Python)
#Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines. (Hint: the string "\n is the same as pressing the ENTER button)

from datetime import datetime

y = input("Please tell me your age? ")
z = input("Please enter a number for a special message? ")

try:
    num = int(y) + int(curr_year)
